Raise Ceiling: +
Lower Floor:   -
Both:          *

General:
  + Explore additive chords (I + vi = vi7, I + iii = Imaj7)
  * Currently the top note is Ti when the bottom is Do. Can we fit one more?
  - Notes are never getting stopped
  - Pulse sometimes gets removed from queue while held
  * Alt chording mode: 1-octave piano-style keyboard for note inclusion
    - Certain buttons like change key, pedal, pulse, etc. would still need dedicated buttons.
  * Press plays closest note (in addition to strum)
    - De-duping might be hard. Not impossible though. We just want to make sure if the press happens left of center on the key, the next swipe right over the center is ignored.
  + Pedal toggle/mod?
