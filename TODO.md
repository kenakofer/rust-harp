## TODO
  - rearrange mods/4 doesn't remove 3
  - Pedal toggle/mod?
  - Phone app version?
  - Check bass balance on keychange
  - Fix held pulse key triggering rapid repeat
  - Pulse in wonky in other keys
  - Explore additive chords (I + vi = vi7, I + iii = Imaj7)
  - Currently the top note is Ti when the bottom is Do. Can we fit one more?
  - NUM_STRINGS is really not that useful, but its used everywhere, even where we should use NUM_NOTES instead. How to find NUM_NOTES?
  - LOWEST_NOTE is not I think the LOWEST_NOTE. Better name, or better concept?
  - wrong sevens on two press
  - play_notes in AppEffects make sense? Maybe just for Pulsing?
  - stop_notes in AppEffects make sense? Don't we need to know active_notes, which is outside?
