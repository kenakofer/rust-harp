## TODO
  - rearrange mods/4 doesn't remove 3
  - Pedal toggle/mod?
  - Phone app version?
    - [x] Extract platform-agnostic core (AppState/chords/notes + core events/effects) into lib.rs
    - [ ] Add UI frontends (winit-desktop, android-touch) that emit core input events
      - [x] winit-desktop frontend module
      - [ ] android-touch frontend module
    - Add output backends (midi today; android audio+dsp + haptics later) consuming core effects
    - Implement plucked-string synth (Karplus–Strong / modal) + rate-limited haptic ticks on crossings
    - Build Android APKs in GitHub Actions (publish as artifacts) to avoid installing SDK/NDK/Gradle locally
  - Check bass balance on keychange
  - Explore additive chords (I + vi = vi7, I + iii = Imaj7)
  - Currently the top note is Ti when the bottom is Do. Can we fit one more?
  - NUM_STRINGS is really not that useful, but its used everywhere, even where we should use NUM_NOTES instead. How to find NUM_NOTES?
  - Notes never getting stopped
  - Pulse can get removed from queue while held
  - Need to create new event for strum note crossings to pass to app_state for filtering.
    - This will let us keep track of notes on and off.
