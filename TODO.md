## TODO
  - rearrange mods/4 doesn't remove 3
  - Pedal toggle/mod?
  - Phone app version?
  - Check bass balance on keychange
  - Explore additive chords (I + vi = vi7, I + iii = Imaj7)
  - Currently the top note is Ti when the bottom is Do. Can we fit one more?
  - NUM_STRINGS is really not that useful, but its used everywhere, even where we should use NUM_NOTES instead. How to find NUM_NOTES?
  - Notes never getting stopped
  - Pulse can get removed from queue while held
  - Need to create new event for strum note crossings to pass to app_state for filtering.
    - This will let us keep track of notes on and off.
